- Verify spacing and alignment

## Design Principles

Throughout all phases, we'll adhere to these core principles:

1. **Focus on Content**: Design should never distract from the primary content
2. **Consistency**: Elements should behave predictably across the app
3. **Responsive Feedback**: Every action should have clear visual feedback
4. **Efficient Interactions**: Minimize steps needed to accomplish tasks
5. **Attention to Detail**: Small refinements create a premium experience

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing design changes:

1. Always use the design system components from Theme.swift
2. Follow the spacing constants for consistent layout
3. Use system animations when possible for better performance
4. Test all changes in both light and dark mode
5. Verify accessibility with VoiceOver
6. Add proper haptic feedback for important actions

## Next Steps for v0.3.3

1. **Complete Note Cards & Lists Enhancements**
   - Finish applying new card styling consistently
   - Implement remaining animation improvements
   - Finalize empty state designs

2. **Beta Testing Preparation**
   - Create testing tasks focused on visual consistency
   - Document known design issues for testers to validate
   - Prepare survey questions about the visual experience

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create design system documentation
   - Update UI component usage guidelines
   - Prepare visual style guide for future developers
