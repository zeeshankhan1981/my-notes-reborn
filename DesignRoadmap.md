## Design Principles

Throughout all phases, we'll adhere to these core principles:

1. **Focus on Content**: Design should never distract from the primary content
2. **Consistency**: Elements should behave predictably across the app
3. **Responsive Feedback**: Every action should have clear visual feedback
4. **Efficient Interactions**: Minimize steps needed to accomplish tasks
5. **Attention to Detail**: Small refinements create a premium experience

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing design changes:

1. Always use the design system components from Theme.swift
2. Follow the spacing constants for consistent layout
3. Use system animations when possible for better performance
4. Test all changes in both light and dark mode
5. Verify accessibility with VoiceOver
6. Add proper haptic feedback for important actions
