# MyNotes Design Audit

## Overview

This design audit examines the current state of the MyNotes app, comparing it against Todoist's design principles and identifying opportunities for improvement. The goal is to create a cleaner, more intuitive interface while maintaining the app's minimalist philosophy.

## Design Principles (Inspired by Todoist)

1. **Clean & Focused**: Every screen should have a clear purpose with minimal distractions
2. **Consistent Visual Language**: Elements should behave predictably across the app
3. **Thoughtful Animations**: Animations should guide users and provide feedback
4. **Accessible**: Design should work for all users regardless of abilities
5. **Detail-oriented**: Small details create a premium feel
