# MyNotes Design Audit

## Overview

This design audit examines the current state of the MyNotes app, comparing it against Todoist's design principles and identifying opportunities for improvement. The goal is to create a cleaner, more intuitive interface while maintaining the app's minimalist philosophy.

## Design Principles (Inspired by Todoist)

1. **Clean & Focused**: Every screen should have a clear purpose with minimal distractions
2. **Consistent Visual Language**: Elements should behave predictably across the app
3. **Thoughtful Animations**: Animations should guide users and provide feedback
4. **Accessible**: Design should work for all users regardless of abilities
5. **Detail-oriented**: Small details create a premium feel

## Current App Assessment

### Color System

| Element | Current Implementation | Todoist Inspiration | Recommendation |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Primary Color | Blue | Red (brand) | Create a consistent brand color (consider forest green) |
| Background | White | Light gray/white | Add subtle texture or gradient for depth |
| Text | Black, Dark Gray, Gray | High contrast with background | Maintain high contrast but soften primary text |
| Status Colors | Standard (red, green, blue) | Muted with personality | Create custom status colors with better harmony |
| Dark Mode | Limited | Full support with custom palette | Implement full dark mode with proper contrast |

### Typography

| Element | Current Implementation | Todoist Inspiration | Recommendation |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Headings | System font, varying weights | Clear hierarchy with custom font | Implement stronger visual hierarchy |
| Body Text | System font, monospaced for editor | Clean, highly readable | Keep monospaced for editor, improve readability elsewhere |
| Line Height | 1.6 | Varies by context | Maintain but adjust for different content types |
| Font Sizes | Limited range | Comprehensive scale | Create more comprehensive typographic scale |

### Components

| Component | Current State | Todoist Example | Improvement Opportunity |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Cards | Basic white cards | Subtle depth, clear hierarchy | Add subtle elevation, improve content spacing |
| Lists | Basic implementation | Rich interaction, clear hierarchy | Enhance with animations, better spacing |
| Buttons | Minimal styling | Clear hierarchy, good feedback | Add hover/active states, better feedback |
| Input Fields | Basic | Clear focus states, helpful validation | Improve focus states and validation feedback |
| Empty States | Basic | Informative, actionable, delightful | Create rich, helpful empty states |
| Navigation | Tab-based | Smooth transitions, clear structure | Enhance transitions between views |
| Toolbar (Rich Text) | Recently improved with SF Symbols | Context-sensitive, unobtrusive | Further refine grouping and accessibility |

### Interactions & Animations

| Feature | Current Implementation | Todoist Approach | Recommended Changes |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| List Transitions | Basic | Smooth, physical animations | Add appropriate enter/exit animations |
| Button Feedback | Minimal | Clear visual + haptic feedback | Add micro-animations and haptic feedback |
| Gestures | Basic swipe actions | Rich gesture system with feedback | Enhance gesture recognition and feedback |
| State Changes | Abrupt | Smooth transitions | Add transitions between states |
| Loading States | Minimal | Skeleton UI, smooth loaders | Implement skeleton UI for loading states |
